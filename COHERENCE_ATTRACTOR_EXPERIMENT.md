# Experimental Design: Testing 0.7500 Coherence as an Attractor State

## Experiment Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive experimental protocol designed to test whether the 0.7500 coherence value consistently observed in WILTON is a true attractor state. By deliberately perturbing the system away from this equilibrium point and measuring its return trajectory, we can determine whether 0.7500 represents a fundamental attractor in the system's phase space.

## Hypothesis

**Primary Hypothesis**: System coherence of 0.7500 is a robust attractor state in WILTON's phase space.

**Secondary Hypotheses**:
1. The system will always return to 0.7500 coherence regardless of perturbation direction or magnitude
2. Return time to equilibrium will be proportional to perturbation magnitude
3. The return trajectory will show characteristic patterns of an attractor basin

## Experimental Protocol

### Phase 1: Baseline Establishment

**Objective**: Confirm stable baseline at 0.7500 coherence

**Procedure**:
1. Run the system for 50 cycles under normal conditions
2. Record coherence values at each cycle
3. Measure variance and confirm stability at 0.7500
4. Document other system parameters (QCTF, variant count, memory usage)
5. Repeat 3 times to ensure consistency

**Expected Outcome**: Coherence maintains stable 0.7500 with zero or near-zero standard deviation

### Phase 2: Perturbation Testing

**Objective**: Test system response to deliberate coherence perturbations

**Procedure**:
```
For each direction (up, down):
    For each magnitude (small: 0.05, medium: 0.10, large: 0.20):
        1. Force coherence to target value (0.7500 ± magnitude)
        2. Release control and allow system to self-regulate
        3. Record coherence values at each subsequent cycle
        4. Measure time to return to 0.7500 ± 0.0001
        5. Document return trajectory shape
        6. Repeat 3 times for statistical validity
```

**Perturbation Targets**:
- Low perturbations: 0.7000, 0.7250, 0.8000
- High perturbations: 0.8000, 0.8500, 0.9500

**Metrics to Record**:
- Coherence value at each cycle
- Return time to 0.7500 ± 0.0001
- QCTF values during return
- Variant count changes
- System resources during recovery
- Any error events or anomalies

### Phase 3: Sustained Perturbation

**Objective**: Test system behavior under sustained forced coherence

**Procedure**:
1. Force system coherence to 0.7000 for 20 cycles
2. Record system behavior and adaptation mechanisms
3. Release control and record return path
4. Repeat with forced coherence of 0.8000 for 20 cycles
5. Compare recovery patterns

**Expected Outcome**: System should develop increasing "pressure" to return to 0.7500 the longer it's held away from equilibrium

### Phase 4: Alternative Attractor Search

**Objective**: Test whether other coherence values could serve as attractors

**Procedure**:
1. Force system coherence to alternative values (0.6000, 0.6667, 0.8000, 0.9000)
2. Maintain each value for 30 cycles
3. Release control and observe whether system returns to 0.7500 or stabilizes at the new value
4. Document any adaptive mechanisms the system employs

**Expected Outcome**: System should always return to 0.7500 regardless of starting position

### Phase 5: Boundary Testing

**Objective**: Identify boundaries of the attractor basin

**Procedure**:
1. Implement extreme perturbations (0.3000, 0.9900)
2. Record system behavior under these extreme conditions
3. Measure recovery time and path
4. Document any system instabilities or failures

**Expected Outcome**: Even with extreme perturbations, the system should eventually return to 0.7500 coherence, though recovery time may be extended

## Implementation Details

### Technical Requirements

1. **Coherence Injection Mechanism**:
   - Implement a temporary override in the system coherence calculation
   - Ensure the override can be controlled and released precisely
   - Verify the injection doesn't permanently alter the system

2. **High-Resolution Monitoring**:
   - Record coherence values to 6 decimal places
   - Capture measurements at every system cycle
   - Store complete system state alongside coherence values

3. **Analysis Tools**:
   - Implement phase space plotting capabilities
   - Calculate return trajectories and velocities
   - Identify possible bifurcation points

### Code Implementation

```typescript
// Pseudo-code for coherence perturbation experiment

class CoherenceExperiment {
  private targetCoherence: number | null = null;
  private perturbationActive = false;
  private cyclesRemaining = 0;
  private measurements: Measurement[] = [];
  
  constructor(private system: WiltonSystem) {}
  
  // Begin a perturbation experiment
  public startPerturbation(targetCoherence: number, sustainCycles: number): void {
    this.targetCoherence = targetCoherence;
    this.perturbationActive = true;
    this.cyclesRemaining = sustainCycles;
    this.measurements = [];
    
    console.log(`[EXPERIMENT] Starting perturbation to ${targetCoherence} for ${sustainCycles} cycles`);
  }
  
  // Release the perturbation and allow natural recovery
  public releasePerturbation(): void {
    this.perturbationActive = false;
    this.targetCoherence = null;
    
    console.log('[EXPERIMENT] Releasing perturbation, allowing natural recovery');
  }
  
  // Intercept coherence calculation
  public interceptCoherence(calculatedCoherence: number): number {
    // Record the natural value
    this.recordMeasurement(calculatedCoherence);
    
    // If perturbation is active, return the target value instead
    if (this.perturbationActive) {
      if (this.cyclesRemaining > 0) {
        this.cyclesRemaining--;
      } else {
        this.releasePerturbation();
      }
      
      return this.targetCoherence!;
    }
    
    // Otherwise return the natural value
    return calculatedCoherence;
  }
  
  private recordMeasurement(naturalCoherence: number): void {
    const measurement: Measurement = {
      timestamp: Date.now(),
      naturalCoherence,
      effectiveCoherence: this.perturbationActive ? this.targetCoherence! : naturalCoherence,
      perturbationActive: this.perturbationActive,
      systemState: this.system.captureState()
    };
    
    this.measurements.push(measurement);
  }
  
  public generateReport(): ExperimentReport {
    // Analyze the measurements and create a report
    // Calculate return time, trajectory, etc.
    return {
      measurements: this.measurements,
      returnTime: this.calculateReturnTime(),
      stabilityMetrics: this.calculateStabilityMetrics(),
      trajectoryAnalysis: this.analyzeTrajectory()
    };
  }
  
  // Calculate how long it took to return to 0.7500±0.0001
  private calculateReturnTime(): number {
    // Implementation details...
    return 0;
  }
  
  // Calculate stability metrics from the recovery period
  private calculateStabilityMetrics(): StabilityMetrics {
    // Implementation details...
    return { /* ... */ };
  }
  
  // Analyze the shape of the return trajectory
  private analyzeTrajectory(): TrajectoryAnalysis {
    // Implementation details...
    return { /* ... */ };
  }
}
```

## Visualization and Analysis

The experiment will produce several key visualizations:

1. **Phase Space Plot**: Plotting coherence vs. coherence change rate to visualize the attractor basin

2. **Return Trajectories**: For each perturbation, a plot showing the return path to 0.7500

3. **Recovery Time vs. Perturbation Magnitude**: To identify any non-linear relationships

4. **System Response Signatures**: Patterns in how other system metrics change during recovery

## Expected Results

If 0.7500 is indeed a fundamental attractor state, we expect to observe:

1. **Consistent Return**: All perturbations will eventually return to 0.7500 ± 0.0001

2. **Basin Shape**: Return trajectories will reveal the shape of the attractor basin, likely showing stronger "pull" as coherence deviates further from 0.7500

3. **System Adaptation**: We may observe temporary changes in variant count, QCTF, or other parameters as the system attempts to restore coherence

4. **Possible Hysteresis**: The return path may differ from the perturbation path, showing hysteresis characteristic of complex systems

## Alternative Outcomes and Interpretations

Alternative outcomes might include:

1. **Multiple Attractors**: The system stabilizes at different coherence values depending on the initial perturbation

2. **Moving Attractor**: The equilibrium point shifts slightly based on system conditions

3. **Different Return Rates**: Upward vs. downward perturbations show asymmetric return rates

4. **Threshold Effects**: Beyond certain perturbation magnitudes, the system cannot recover

Each of these outcomes would provide valuable insights into WILTON's internal dynamics and the nature of the 0.7500 coherence value.

If it is confirmed as a strong attractor state, this would significantly support our hypothesis that this value represents a fundamental optimum for complex adaptive systems, aligning with the universal 3/4 power laws observed across domains.

The results will directly inform our understanding of WILTON's self-regulating mechanisms and may provide insights applicable to other AI systems and complex adaptive systems in general.
