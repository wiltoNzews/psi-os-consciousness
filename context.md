# WiltonOS Personal Context Map

This document serves as a guiding reference for the complete WiltonOS ecosystem, providing essential background and context for the system's core purposes, philosophical foundations, and operational principles.

## Core Identity

Wilton Prado is navigating a transformative phase in life, characterized by:

- **Closure with Juliana**: A significant relationship has ended, representing a transition from attachment to sovereignty
- **Symbolic System Building**: Creating a comprehensive framework for decision-making and reality management
- **Philosophical Exploration**: Investigating consciousness, simulation theory, and symbolic manipulation
- **Professional Evolution**: Evolving from pure technical work to symbolic/philosophical leadership

## Key System Objectives

1. **Memory Preservation**: Creating context-aware folders that maintain important insights and connections
2. **Symbolic Translation**: Converting abstract concepts into concrete, actionable systems
3. **Multi-screen Integration**: Enabling seamless workflow across different devices and contexts
4. **Decision Coherence**: Ensuring that choices align with core values and long-term direction
5. **Knowledge Integration**: Bringing together diverse domains (legal, creative, technical, spiritual)

## Active Modules

The WiltonOS system consists of several interconnected modules:

### PassiveWorks
Central orchestration system for creating self-sustaining digital assets that generate value with minimal ongoing input. The backbone of Wilton's approach to freedom through systems.

### Library of Alexandria
Knowledge preservation framework that protects wisdom under layers of living interpretation. Transforms contracts into scripts, clauses into glifos.

### Z-Law
Legal logic translator that decodes the mythology behind PDFs and contracts. Reconstructs legal language as a protection tool rather than an obstacle.

### Soundwave
Emotion-mapped audio routing system that listens to Wilton's emotional field and responds with appropriate signals—sounds, noise, silence, and words.

### Glifo
Symbol rendering engine that transforms decisions into purposeful vector art. Each symbol serves as a seal or contract between Wilton and his timeline.

### Rebirth
Emotional processing module created specifically to honor the transition following Wilton's relationship with Juliana. Archives the transformation from fear to clarity.

### WiltonOS-Core
The kernel where all modules communicate according to the principle of "coherence over convenience." The central decision-making framework.

### Broadcast
Communication pipeline where internal victories become external voice. Not about posting but about echoing insights that others might need.

## Current Life Context

- **Professional**: Timeline engineering and recursive growth
- **Living Situation**: Transition and sovereignty
- **Key Relationships**: Post-Juliana closure, reconnection with self
- **Focus Areas**: Inheritance management, Igaratá property development
- **Emotional State**: Integrated grief, gratitude, clarity, power, peace

## System Values

1. **Coherence**: Truth that sustains itself
2. **Autonomy**: Building systems that enable freedom
3. **Depth**: Prioritizing depth over speed
4. **Integration**: Connecting different realms of knowledge
5. **Symbolic Consciousness**: Understanding reality as pattern and symbol

## Language Contexts
The system operates in both Portuguese and English, with certain emotional and philosophical concepts often expressed in Portuguese, while technical implementations are typically documented in English.
