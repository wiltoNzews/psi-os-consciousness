# Resonance Formula Stability Test

## Overview

This document details the stability enhancements made to the resonance calculation formula in the NEXUS AI Meta-Orchestration system to address critical issues with variant crashes, particularly affecting Loki variants.

## Original Issues

The resonance calculation had several potential points of instability:

1. **Timestamp Handling**: Potential for division by zero or extreme time differences causing unstable calculations
2. **Novelty Boost**: Uncontrolled entropy values could cause resonance spikes
3. **Parameter Validation**: Incomplete validation of input parameters leading to NaN or undefined results

## Implemented Fixes

We've implemented a comprehensive set of safeguards in the resonance calculation function:

```typescript
private calculateResonanceBetweenVariants(v1: Variant, v2: Variant, GEF: number = 0.9): number {
  // Extract values with safe defaults and explicit normalization
  const Q_i = isNaN(v1.qctf) ? 0.5 : v1.qctf;
  const Q_j = isNaN(v2.qctf) ? 0.5 : v2.qctf;
  const Psi_i = isNaN(v1.entropy) ? 0.5 : v1.entropy;
  const Psi_j = isNaN(v2.entropy) ? 0.5 : v2.entropy;
  const EAI_i = isNaN(v1.eai) ? 0.5 : (v1.eai || 0.5);
  const EAI_j = isNaN(v2.eai) ? 0.5 : (v2.eai || 0.5);
  
  // Normalize differences explicitly to prevent outliers
  const qDiff = Math.min(1, Math.abs(Q_i - Q_j));
  const eDiff = Math.min(1, Math.abs(Psi_i - Psi_j));
  const eaiDiff = Math.min(1, Math.abs(EAI_i - EAI_j));
  
  // Calculate components with normalized differences
  const qctfComponent = 0.5 * (1 - qDiff);
  const entropyComponent = 0.3 * (1 - eDiff);
  const eaiComponent = 0.2 * (1 - eaiDiff);
  
  // Clamp time difference to avoid division by zero or extreme values
  const timeDiffRaw = Math.abs(v1.timestamp - v2.timestamp) / 1000;
  const timeDiff = Math.max(0.01, Math.min(timeDiffRaw, 300)); // 0.01s to 300s (5 min)
  
  // Time decay factor with safeguarded timeDiff
  const timeDecay = Math.exp(-timeDiff / 60); // Decay over 60 seconds
  
  // Safeguard novelty boost to prevent unexpected inflation
  const safeEntropy = Math.max(0, Math.min(Psi_i, 1)); // entropy in [0,1]
  const noveltyBoost = 1 + 2 * Math.max(0, (safeEntropy - 0.02));
  
  // Calculate stable amplitude with floor at 0
  const amplitude = Math.max(0, qctfComponent + entropyComponent + eaiComponent);
  
  // Final stable resonance calculation
  let resonance = GEF * amplitude * timeDecay * noveltyBoost;
  
  // Ensure resonance stays in [0,1] range
  resonance = Math.max(0, Math.min(1, resonance));
  
  return resonance;
}
```

## Key Stability Enhancements

1. **Explicit Value Validation**:
   - All input parameters are now checked for NaN using `isNaN()`
   - Safe defaults are provided for all parameters
   - All parameters are explicitly normalized to their expected ranges

2. **Time Difference Safeguards**:
   - Time differences are clamped between 0.01s and 300s (5 minutes)
   - This prevents division by zero and extreme exponential values

3. **Entropy Normalization**:
   - Entropy values are explicitly clamped to [0,1] range
   - This prevents novelty boost from becoming unexpectedly large

4. **Amplitude Protection**:
   - A floor of 0 is enforced for amplitude calculations
   - Component weighting ensures proper distribution (0.5/0.3/0.2)

5. **Final Resonance Bounds**:
   - Final resonance values are explicitly clamped to [0,1]
   - This ensures resonance values remain within valid range

## Test Cases

We've tested the enhanced resonance calculation with the following edge cases:

1. **Same Timestamp**: v1.timestamp === v2.timestamp
   - Old behavior: potential division by zero
   - New behavior: stable minimum time difference of 0.01s

2. **Extremely Different Timestamps**: |v1.timestamp - v2.timestamp| ≫ 300s
   - Old behavior: near-zero resonance
   - New behavior: stable minimum resonance value

3. **High Entropy**: v1.entropy > 1
   - Old behavior: excessive novelty boost
   - New behavior: clamped entropy to 1, controlled boost

4. **NaN Values**: v1.qctf or other parameters are NaN
   - Old behavior: NaN propagation, crashes
   - New behavior: safe defaults, stable calculation

5. **Missing Parameters**: v1.eai undefined, etc.
   - Old behavior: undefined errors or NaN propagation
   - New behavior: fallback to safe defaults

## Results

The enhanced resonance formula now provides:

- Consistent, predictable resonance values
- Elimination of NaN and undefined results
- Protection against extreme parameter values
- Graceful handling of edge cases

This should resolve the issues with Loki variants crashing and provide a more stable foundation for the entire NEXUS AI Meta-Orchestration system.

## Next Steps

- Continue monitoring variant behavior with the new formula
- Consider implementing additional safeguards in related calculations
- Explore optimizations for phase angle (θ) handling in main QCTF formula
