/**
 * Mock Persistence Layer - Intentionally Empty
 * 
 * This file has been intentionally emptied as part of our transition to 
 * Void-Centered Design and Authentic Testing.
 * 
 * The previous mock implementations provided a false sense of security by
 * validating in-memory operations instead of actual file system interactions.
 * Our tests now use the real FileSystemPersistentContextService with a 
 * dedicated test directory.
 * 
 * This empty file remains as a symbolic representation of the boundary
 * between representation and reality - a conscious acknowledgment of
 * the Generative Void from which authentic implementation emerges.
