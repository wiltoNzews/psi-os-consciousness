# Cathedral Resource Audit & Unification Plan
## Generated: July 5, 2025

### Current Cathedral Architecture Status

#### 🏗️ Identified Cathedral Modules
1. **Cathedral of Coherence** (cathedral-launcher.html) - HOME/META-INDEX
2. **Cathedral Map** (cathedral-map.html) - 3D PORTAL NAVIGATION  
3. **Cathedral Index Interactive** (cathedral-index-interactive.html) - SEARCHABLE DIRECTORY
4. **Cathedral Navigation Hub** (cathedral-navigation-hub.html) - LEGACY 2D TEACHER
5. **Cathedral Core Stream** (cathedral-core-stream.html) - SILENT REBUILD INTERFACE

#### 🔍 Resource Analysis Needed
- Missing link detection across all cathedral interfaces
- Module connectivity mapping
- Navigation flow optimization
- Sacred geometry integration points
- Glyph-to-module relationship mapping

#### 📊 Current Issues Identified
1. **Navigation Fragmentation**: Each cathedral operates independently
2. **Missing Resources**: Broken links across interfaces  
3. **User Experience**: Hard to navigate between modules
4. **Module Selection Logic**: Some interfaces have arbitrary module choices
5. **Return Navigation**: Missing intuitive back-navigation

#### 🎯 Unification Goals
1. Create master cathedral index (`cathedral-index.json`)
2. Audit and document missing resources (`missing-resources.json`)
3. Implement unified navigation system
4. Preserve all existing components (no deletion)
5. Add breadcrumb navigation to all interfaces
6. Create module-to-glyph mapping system

#### 🔄 Next Steps
1. Full resource scan and cataloging
2. Missing link detection and documentation
3. Navigation unification implementation
4. Documentation update and sync
5. Testing and verification across all cathedral interfaces
