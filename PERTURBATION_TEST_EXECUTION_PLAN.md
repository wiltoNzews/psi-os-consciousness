# Perturbation Test Execution Plan

## Objective

To empirically verify that the 0.7500 coherence value is a true attractor state in our system's phase space by perturbing the system away from this equilibrium and observing whether it naturally returns to the 0.7500 value.

## Experiment Design

Our experiment will use the `coherence-attractor-experiment.ts` script, which implements a rigorous protocol to:

1. Establish a baseline measurement of the system at its natural coherence (expected to be 0.7500)
2. Apply controlled perturbations by forcing the system coherence to various values away from 0.7500
3. Release the perturbations and measure the return trajectory of the system
4. Analyze whether the system reliably returns to 0.7500 regardless of the direction and magnitude of perturbation

## Test Phases

The experiment is structured in four phases with increasing perturbation magnitudes:

1. **Small Perturbations (±0.05-0.075)**: 
   - Target values: 0.7000, 0.7250, 0.8000, 0.8250
   - Tests system response to minor perturbations

2. **Medium Perturbations (±0.1-0.125)**:
   - Target values: 0.6500, 0.6750, 0.8500, 0.8750
   - Tests system response to moderate perturbations

3. **Large Perturbations (±0.15-0.25)**:
   - Target values: 0.5000, 0.5500, 0.9000, 0.9500
   - Tests system response to major perturbations

4. **Sustained Perturbations**:
   - Longer duration tests with selected values to see if extended periods away from 0.7500 affect return behavior

Each target value is tested multiple times (2 repetitions per default configuration) to ensure statistical reliability.

## Execution Steps

1. **Prepare the Environment**:
   - Ensure the application server is running in a clean, stable state via `npm run dev`
   - Verify WebSocket connectivity to localhost:5000/ws

2. **Run the Experiment**:
   ```bash
   # Install ts-node if not already installed
   npm install -g ts-node
   
   # Run the experiment
   ts-node coherence-attractor-experiment.ts
   ```

3. **Monitor the Experiment**:
   - The script will output progress logs showing:
     - Baseline coherence measurements
     - Each perturbation application and release
     - System measurements during recovery phases
   - Expected runtime: approximately 30-45 minutes for the full experiment

4. **Analyze Results**:
   - After completion, the script will generate a comprehensive report in JSON format and a human-readable summary
   - The report will classify the 0.7500 value as an attractor state and evaluate its strength based on:
     - Return time (how quickly the system returns to 0.7500)
     - Return reliability (whether it always returns regardless of perturbation)
     - Alternative attractors (whether other stable states were detected)

## Expected Outcomes

If our hypothesis is correct, we expect to observe:

1. The system consistently returning to 0.7500 coherence after perturbations are released
2. Faster return times for small perturbations, longer for large ones
3. No alternative stable states (no other attractors in the phase space)
4. The strength of the 0.7500 attractor classified as "strong" or "very strong"

## Documentation

The experiment will automatically generate:

1. A JSON report with detailed measurements of all test cycles
2. A human-readable summary with key findings
3. Classification of the 0.7500 value as an attractor state with quantified strength

These results will be used as empirical evidence in the whitepaper to support our claim that 0.7500 represents a universal attractor state guided by the 3/4 power law observed across different domains.

## Contingency Plans

1. If WebSocket connectivity issues occur, the experiment will exit gracefully with error logs
2. If unexpected system behavior is observed, we can modify the experiment parameters to:
   - Try different perturbation values
   - Increase observation cycles for better statistical significance
   - Add more repetitions to confirm unusual findings
