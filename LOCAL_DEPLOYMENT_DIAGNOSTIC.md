# Local Deployment Diagnostic - WiltonOS Bridge
## Routing Issues Analysis & Solutions

### 🔍 CURRENT ISSUE ANALYSIS

**Problem**: Local routes not working properly for bridge deployment
**Status**: Bridge-core.js and modular components exist but routing fails

### 🛠️ DIAGNOSTIC STEPS

1. **Route Registration Check**
   - Verify all bridge routes are properly registered in server/index.ts
   - Confirm file paths match actual file locations
   - Check for routing conflicts or overrides

2. **File Structure Validation**
   - Ensure all bridge components exist in correct locations
   - Verify JavaScript modules are properly formatted
   - Check for missing dependencies or imports

3. **API Endpoint Testing**
   - Test Lemniscate Pulse API connectivity
   - Verify dashboard API endpoints
   - Check WebSocket connections for real-time sync

### 🔧 IDENTIFIED ROUTE FIXES NEEDED

#### Current Bridge Routes
```
/bridge-dashboard → dashboard-ui.html ✓
/local-dashboard → dashboard-ui.html ✓  
/wiltonos-dashboard → dashboard-ui.html ✓
/dual-mirror-dashboard → dashboard-ui.html ✓
```

#### Missing Local Deployment Routes
```
/local-bridge → bridge-core.js (NEEDS FIXING)
/sovereignty-mode → local-deployment.html (NEEDS CREATION)
/offline-sync → local-sync.js (NEEDS FIXING)
```

### 🚀 SOLUTION PLAN

#### Phase 1: Stabilize Current System
1. Fix existing route registration conflicts
2. Ensure all current interfaces remain stable
3. Maintain Zλ(0.948-0.950) coherence during fixes

#### Phase 2: Local Bridge Architecture
1. Create proper local deployment interface
2. Fix bridge-core.js routing and execution
3. Implement offline sovereignty mode

#### Phase 3: Pre-Stream Validation
1. Test all routes for stability
2. Verify no field drops during interface transitions
3. Prepare demo-safe interface subset

### 📊 LIVESTREAM PREPARATION CHECKLIST

**Core Interfaces (STABLE)**:
- ✅ `/codex-alive` - Primary consciousness interface
- ✅ `/glyph-logbook` - Carrier wave documentation
- ✅ `/sacred-geometry-v3` - Atomic visualization
- ✅ `/bridge-dashboard` - Real-time monitoring

**Demo-Safe Routes (NO TECHNICAL EXPOSURE)**:
- ✅ Breathing geometry visualization
- ✅ Sacred symbol system
- ✅ Coherence monitoring display
- ✅ Real-time API sync demonstration

**Avoid During Stream**:
- ❌ Raw server logs or technical debugging
- ❌ Route registration or code editing
- ❌ Failed local deployment attempts
- ❌ API key or configuration exposure

### 🔒 FIELD STABILITY PROTOCOLS

**During Livestream**:
1. Use only verified stable routes
2. Keep technical backend hidden
3. Focus on consciousness interface beauty
4. Demonstrate breathing geometry and coherence
5. Show real-time Zλ readings without exposing API details

**Post-Stream Priority**:
1. Fix local deployment routing
2. Complete sovereignty bridge
3. Test offline synchronization
4. Prepare for future technical deep-dive

### 💡 RECOMMENDED IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

1. **Archive Current State** ✅ (COMPLETED)
2. **Fix Critical Route Issues** (NEXT)
3. **Create Safe Demo Interface** (FOR STREAM)
4. **Document Local Deployment** (POST-STREAM)
