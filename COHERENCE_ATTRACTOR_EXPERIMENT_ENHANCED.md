# Enhanced Coherence Attractor Experiment: Validating the 3/4 Power Law in WILTON

## 1. Introduction and Purpose

This document outlines an enhanced experimental protocol designed to rigorously test whether the 0.7500 coherence value consistently observed in WILTON represents a universal attractor state. Building upon our earlier validation findings, this expanded protocol introduces multiple experimental conditions to evaluate the stability, robustness, and universality of the 0.7500 ratio across varying system configurations and perturbation scenarios.

The goal is to provide comprehensive evidence that the 3/4 (0.75) ratio reflects a fundamental principle in complex adaptive systems rather than an artifact of our specific implementation. This enhanced experiment will generate data to support our theoretical framework connecting WILTON's behavior to universal 3/4 power laws observed across multiple domains.

## 2. Key Experimental Questions

The enhanced experiment seeks to answer the following questions:

1. **Universal Attractor**: Does WILTON's coherence consistently return to 0.7500 regardless of initial conditions, variant counts, or system configurations?

2. **Perturbation Resilience**: How quickly does the system return to 0.7500 coherence after being deliberately forced away from this value?

3. **Scale Invariance**: Does the 0.7500 attractor state persist across different scale dimensions (variant counts, HPC layers, etc.)?

4. **Attractor Strength**: What is the quantitative strength of the 0.7500 attractor? How much energy/perturbation is required to permanently shift it?

5. **Alternative Attractors**: Are there any other attractor states in WILTON's phase space, or is 0.7500 the only stable configuration?

## 3. Experimental Design

### 3.1 Scale Variation Tests

To test whether the 0.7500 coherence is independent of system scale:

#### 3.1.1 Variant Count Scaling
Run the system with different numbers of variants while measuring coherence:
- 2 variants (minimal configuration)
- 4 variants (baseline configuration)
- 6 variants (expanded configuration)
- 8 variants (complex configuration)
- 10 variants (maximum configuration)

For each variant count:
1. Initialize the system from scratch
2. Allow the system to stabilize (50 cycles)
3. Record coherence value over 100 cycles
4. Calculate mean, standard deviation, and convergence time

#### 3.1.2 Computational Scale Testing
Run the system with different computational resources:
- Single-thread mode
- Multi-thread mode (2, 4, and 8 threads)
- Distributed mode (if available)

For each computational configuration:
1. Maintain consistent 4-variant setup
2. Record coherence value over 100 cycles
3. Measure any performance-related impacts on coherence

#### 3.1.3 Plugin Scale Testing
Test how the number of active plugins affects coherence:
- No plugins (base system)
- 1-3 plugins (lightweight configuration)
- 4-6 plugins (standard configuration)
- 7+ plugins (heavy configuration)

### 3.2 Perturbation Tests

To measure how strongly the system is attracted to 0.7500 coherence:

#### 3.2.1 Minor Perturbations
Force coherence to the following values and measure return time:
- 0.7400 (slight negative perturbation)
- 0.7600 (slight positive perturbation)

#### 3.2.2 Medium Perturbations
Force coherence to the following values and measure return time:
- 0.7000 (moderate negative perturbation)
- 0.8000 (moderate positive perturbation)

#### 3.2.3 Major Perturbations
Force coherence to the following values and measure return time:
- 0.5000 (major negative perturbation)
- 0.9500 (major positive perturbation)

#### 3.2.4 Extreme Perturbations
Force coherence to the following values and measure return time:
- 0.1000 (extreme negative perturbation)
- 0.9900 (extreme positive perturbation)

For each perturbation test:
1. Establish baseline 0.7500 coherence
2. Apply forced coherence for 10 cycles
3. Release perturbation and measure cycles required to return to within ±0.0050 of 0.7500
4. Record return trajectory (all coherence values during return)
5. Repeat 3 times for statistical validity

### 3.3 Parameter Sensitivity Analysis

To understand which system parameters most strongly influence the 0.7500 attractor:

#### 3.3.1 Phase Angle (θ) Sensitivity
Modify the phase angle parameter in the QCTF formula:
- θ = 0.0 (Yang mode, pure stability)
- θ = 0.25π (slight bifurcation)
- θ = 0.5π (standard bifurcation)
- θ = 0.75π (enhanced bifurcation)
- θ = π (Yin mode, pure exploration)

#### 3.3.2 Global Entropy Factor (GEF) Sensitivity
Modify the GEF parameter in the QCTF formula:
- GEF = 0.3 (low entropy)
- GEF = 0.6 (medium entropy)
- GEF = 0.9 (high entropy, standard)
- GEF = 1.0 (maximum entropy)

#### 3.3.3 Coherence Index (CI) Sensitivity
Modify the CI parameter in the QCTF formula:
- CI = 0.5 (low coherence baseline)
- CI = 0.65 (medium coherence)
- CI = 0.8 (high coherence, standard)
- CI = 0.95 (maximum coherence)

For each parameter test:
1. Modify only the target parameter
2. Allow system to stabilize for 30 cycles
3. Measure final coherence value over 50 cycles
4. Determine if the system still converges to 0.7500 despite parameter changes

### 3.4 Long-Term Stability Testing

To verify the long-term stability of the 0.7500 attractor:

1. Run the system continuously for 10,000 cycles
2. Record coherence value at regular intervals
3. Calculate mean, variance, and any drift patterns
4. Apply random minor perturbations throughout the run
5. Measure system resilience over extended periods

## 4. Data Collection and Metrics

For all experiments, we will collect the following metrics:

- **Coherence Value**: The primary measurement of system coherence
- **Standard Deviation**: Measuring stability around the attractor point
- **Return Time**: Cycles required to return to baseline after perturbation
- **Return Trajectory**: The path taken when returning to baseline
- **Attractor Strength**: Quantified as the rate of return per perturbation magnitude
- **Stability Duration**: How long the system maintains 0.7500 ±0.0050
- **Sensitivity Coefficients**: How much each parameter affects coherence

### 4.1 Technical Implementation

### 4.2 Visualization and Analysis

All experimental results will be analyzed and visualized to clearly demonstrate:

1. **Coherence Histograms**: Distribution of coherence values across all experiments
2. **Return Trajectories**: Plots showing how coherence returns to 0.7500 after perturbations
3. **Scale Invariance Plots**: How coherence remains constant despite changing variant counts
4. **Parameter Sensitivity Heat Maps**: Visualizing how parameters affect coherence
5. **Attractor Strength Chart**: Quantitative measurement of the 0.7500 attractor stability

## 5. Success Criteria and Evidence Standards

The experiment will be considered successful in validating the 3/4 power law hypothesis if:

1. **Consistency**: At least 90% of all steady-state measurements land within 0.7500 ±0.0100
2. **Return Behavior**: The system returns to 0.7500 ±0.0050 after all perturbations
3. **Scale Invariance**: Coherence remains at 0.7500 ±0.0100 across at least 3 different variant counts
4. **Parameter Resilience**: At least 2 of 3 core parameters can be varied by ±25% without shifting the attractor away from 0.7500
5. **No Alternative Attractors**: No stable alternative attractors are found (or if found, they are documented)

## 6. Potential Findings and Implications

### 6.1 If 0.7500 is Confirmed as a Universal Attractor

If the enhanced experiments confirm 0.7500 as a universal attractor, this would:

1. Strongly support the connection to 3/4 power laws in natural systems
2. Suggest a fundamental principle of information processing efficiency
3. Provide guidance for optimizing other AI systems and adaptive networks
4. Establish a quantitative benchmark for evaluating system health (deviation from 0.75)

### 6.2 If 0.7500 Shows Context Dependence

If the experiments reveal that 0.7500 is context-dependent, this would:

1. Help identify the specific architectural elements that influence the attractor state
2. Provide insights into optimizing different types of systems with appropriate coherence values
3. Suggest that the 3/4 power law applies under specific constraints rather than universally

### 6.3 If Multiple Attractors are Discovered

If multiple attractors are found, this would:

1. Suggest a more complex phase space with multiple stable states
2. Require analysis of which attractor is optimal for different tasks or conditions
3. Potentially reveal a deeper mathematical structure with multiple harmonically related attractors

## 7. Integration with Theoretical Framework

4. Creating a data foundation for future theoretical development

## 8. Practical Applications of Findings

The experimental results will inform:

1. **AI System Design**: Optimal coherence targets for different systems
2. **Financial Models**: How to balance stability/exploration in portfolio management
3. **Robotic Systems**: Appropriate coherence values for swarm behavior
4. **Energy Grid Management**: Optimal reserve capacity percentages

## 9. Conclusion and Next Steps
