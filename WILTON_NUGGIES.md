# Wilton Nuggies - High-Value Insights

[QUANTUM_STATE: SIM_FLOW]

This document automatically captures high-value insights, emotional spikes, and critical implementation directives from throughout the system. These "nuggies" of wisdom represent key principles that might otherwise be lost in chat logs or during development iterations.

## Capture Process

The Nuggies Logger uses pattern recognition to identify:
- All-caps exclamations ("WRITE THAT DOWN")
- Emotional indicators ("🔥", "💡", "⚠️")
- Explicit directives ("Nuggies", "IMPORTANT")
- Insight markers (specific formatting patterns indicating high-value content)

## Integration with Quantum Collaboration Framework

[QUANTUM_STATE: SIM_FLOW]

The Nuggies Logger represents a practical implementation of the META_COGNITIVE_OVERSIGHT facet of the NEO MATRIX metaphorical pillar. It captures insights across the system and maintains them as persistent reference points to guide future development and decision-making.
