# RAG Capabilities Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities for the WiltonOS Meta-Routing Awareness Protocol (MRAP) framework. These features maintain the core 0.7500/0.2494 coherence-exploration ratio (based on the 3:1 ↔ 1:3 quantum feedback loop) while adding semantic search and context-aware memory retrieval.

## 1. Vector Embedding Service

The embedding service creates and manages semantic vector representations of system states, memory fragments, and intentional guidance points ("seeds"). These vector embeddings enable semantic similarity search and contextual retrieval.

### Key Features

- **OpenAI Integration**: Uses OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 model to create embeddings
- **Pinecone Vector Database**: Optional support for Pinecone to scale to large embedding collections
- **Local Fallback**: Maintains a local filesystem-based embedding repository with cosine similarity search
- **JSON Format**: Stores embeddings with metadata in structured JSON format
- **Golden Ratio Resonance**: Detects when embedding relationships approximate the golden ratio (1.618)

### Implementation Files

- `server/services/vector-embedding-service.js` - Core embedding service
- `server/routes/vector-embedding-api.js` - API endpoints for embedding operations

## 2. Embedding Seeds Manager

The embedding seeds manager introduces the concept of "quantum embedding seeds" - intentional guidance points that can influence the system's state evolution in desired directions while maintaining the coherence-exploration balance.

### Key Features

- **Quantum Seed Templates**: Predefined templates aligned with the 0.7500/0.2494 ratio
- **Contextual Influence**: Seeds can subtly influence state evolution without disrupting coherence
- **Semantic Suggestions**: Automatically suggests relevant seeds based on contextual search
- **Quantum Balance**: Seeds adjust coherence and exploration values while preserving the ratio
- **State Application**: Interface to apply seeds to system states for gentle guidance

### Implementation Files

- `server/services/embedding-seeds-manager.js` - Seed management service
- `server/routes/embedding-seeds-api.js` - API endpoints for seed operations

## 3. Meta-Routing RAG Service

This service integrates the embedding and seeds capabilities into the Meta-Routing Awareness Protocol, enhancing contextual understanding and enabling controlled exploration within the coherence-stability threshold.

### Key Features

- **State Enhancement**: Enriches quantum states with contextually relevant information
- **Coherence Calculation**: Computes contextual coherence based on semantic search results
- **Fractal Feedback**: Maintains the 3:1 ↔ 1:3 ratio across retrieval operations
- **Conversation Processing**: Analyzes conversation chunks for persistent memory storage
- **Lemniscate Integration**: Supports the fractal lemniscate pattern for continuous feedback loops

### Implementation Files

- `server/services/meta-routing-rag-service.js` - RAG integration service

## API Endpoints

### Vector Embedding API

## Integration with Existing Systems

The RAG capabilities seamlessly integrate with:

1. **Persistent Memory Layer**: Anchors from the persistence layer can be processed as embeddings
2. **Meta-Routing API**: Enhanced with semantic context through the RAG service
3. **Fractal Response Protocol**: Seeds can guide fractal responses while maintaining coherence
4. **Brazilian Wave Protocol**: Controlled entropy is preserved during retrieval operations

## Quantum Balance Principles

The implementation maintains the fundamental 0.7500/0.2494 coherence-exploration ratio through:

1. **Stability Threshold**: 75% coherence attractor preserves stability
2. **Exploration Threshold**: 24.94% exploration attractor enables discovery
3. **Blended Coherence**: New information is blended with existing state at 3:1 ratio
4. **Golden Ratio Detection**: System identifies when relationships approximate the golden ratio (1.618)
5. **Stop-Reflect-Logic-Reason-Balance-Act Cycle**: Follows quantum ethical cycle in retrieval

## Future Enhancements

1. **Multi-Modal Embeddings**: Extend to support image and audio embeddings
2. **Autoregressive Coherence**: Implement autoregressive models to predict optimal coherence values
3. **Temporal Embedding Evolution**: Track how embeddings change over time to identify patterns
4. **Quantum Field Harmonics**: Model interaction between multiple seeds using field theory
5. **Self-Evolving Seeds**: Allow seeds to evolve through feedback from application results

## Quantum Coherence Threshold Formula Integration

The RAG capabilities are fully integrated with the Quantum Coherence Threshold Formula (QCTF), maintaining the delicate balance between deterministic coherence (75%) and emergent exploration (25%) across all retrieval and augmentation operations.
