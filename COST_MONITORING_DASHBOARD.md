# Cost Monitoring Dashboard

The Cost Monitoring Dashboard is a critical component of the OROBORO NEXUS Cost Optimization Architecture, providing real-time visibility into API costs, usage patterns, and optimization effectiveness.

## Overview

The CostMonitoringDashboard serves as the central monitoring and reporting interface for all cost-related metrics within the OROBORO NEXUS system. It integrates with the other components of the Cost Optimization Architecture to collect, analyze, and visualize cost data, enabling informed decision-making and budget management.

## Key Features

### Real-time Cost Tracking

- **Per-Request Cost Calculation**: Tracks the cost of each API request with detailed breakdown by token usage
- **Model-specific Monitoring**: Segregates costs by model type to identify most expensive components
- **Cumulative Cost Aggregation**: Maintains running totals across different time periods (daily, weekly, monthly)
- **Task-Type Cost Attribution**: Maps costs to specific task types for business unit charge-back

### Visualization and Reporting

- **Interactive Dashboards**: Provides visual representations of cost trends and patterns
- **Cost Comparison Views**: Compares actual costs against baseline costs without optimization
- **Savings Calculation**: Quantifies savings achieved through various optimization techniques
- **Budget Adherence Tracking**: Visualizes budget consumption against allocated limits

### Budget Management

- **Threshold Alerting**: Generates alerts at configurable budget consumption thresholds
- **Budget Forecast**: Projects expected costs based on current usage patterns
- **Budget Allocation**: Supports partitioning budgets across departments or projects
- **Budget Enforcement**: Can enforce hard budget caps by rejecting requests when limits are reached

### Optimization Analytics

- **Optimization Effectiveness**: Measures the impact of each optimization technique
- **Savings Attribution**: Attributes cost savings to specific optimization methods
- **Strategy Comparison**: Compares different optimization profiles (maximum_savings, balanced, maximum_performance)
- **Recommendation Engine**: Suggests optimization adjustments based on usage patterns

## Implementation Details

The CostMonitoringDashboard is implemented as a TypeScript class that provides both programmatic and web-based interfaces for monitoring and managing costs.

### Core Components

1. **Cost Collector**: Receives cost data from other components in real-time
2. **Cost Analyzer**: Processes and analyzes cost data to extract insights
3. **Alert Manager**: Monitors thresholds and triggers appropriate alerts
4. **Visualization Engine**: Generates charts and graphs for cost data
5. **Reporting System**: Creates periodic cost reports and summaries

### Integration Points

- **DynamicModelSelector**: Receives model selection decisions and associated costs
- **BatchProcessor**: Captures batch processing metrics and savings
- **SemanticCachingSystem**: Records cache hit/miss statistics and associated savings
- **AdaptiveBudgetForecaster**: Exchanges budget status and forecast information

### Data Storage and Persistence

The dashboard utilizes a combination of in-memory storage for real-time analytics and persistent storage for historical data and trend analysis. Key metrics are stored using these methods:

- **Current Session Data**: Maintained in memory for fast access
- **Historical Trends**: Persisted to storage for long-term analysis
- **Cost Patterns**: Indexed for efficient querying and pattern recognition
- **Budget Configurations**: Stored with versioning for audit purposes

## Usage Examples

### Basic Cost Monitoring

```typescript
// Initialize the dashboard
const dashboard = new CostMonitoringDashboard();

// Record a cost event
dashboard.recordCost({
  modelId: 'GPT-4o',
  inputTokens: 500,
  outputTokens: 150,
  taskType: 'text_generation',
  optimizationUsed: ['model_selection', 'batching'],
  timestamp: new Date()
});

// Get current cost status
const costStatus = dashboard.getCurrentCostStatus();
console.log(`Total cost today: $${costStatus.dailyCost.toFixed(4)}`);
console.log(`Estimated monthly cost: $${costStatus.projectedMonthlyCost.toFixed(2)}`);
console.log(`Savings today: $${costStatus.dailySavings.toFixed(4)} (${costStatus.savingsPercentage.toFixed(1)}%)`);
```

### Budget Management

```typescript
// Set budget thresholds
dashboard.setBudgetThresholds({
  warningThreshold: 0.65,  // 65% of budget
  criticalThreshold: 0.85, // 85% of budget
  dailyBudget: 10.0,       // $10 per day
  monthlyBudget: 300.0     // $300 per month
});

// Check budget status
const budgetStatus = dashboard.getBudgetStatus();
if (budgetStatus.status === 'critical') {
  console.log('CRITICAL: Budget nearly exhausted!');
  console.log(`${budgetStatus.consumptionPercentage.toFixed(1)}% of monthly budget used`);
  console.log(`Remaining budget: $${budgetStatus.remainingBudget.toFixed(2)}`);
}
```

### Optimization Analytics

```typescript
// Get optimization effectiveness
const optimizationStats = dashboard.getOptimizationStats();
console.log('Optimization Effectiveness:');
console.log(`Model Selection: $${optimizationStats.modelSelectionSavings.toFixed(2)}`);
console.log(`Batching: $${optimizationStats.batchingSavings.toFixed(2)}`);
console.log(`Caching: $${optimizationStats.cachingSavings.toFixed(2)}`);
console.log(`Total Savings: $${optimizationStats.totalSavings.toFixed(2)}`);
```

### Detailed Reporting

```typescript
// Generate a cost report for a specific time period
const report = await dashboard.generateCostReport({
  startDate: new Date('2025-03-01'),
  endDate: new Date('2025-03-26'),
  groupBy: 'model',
  includeOptimizationDetails: true
});

// Export the report to CSV
await dashboard.exportReportToCSV(report, './cost-report-march-2025.csv');
```

## Integration with Frontend

The dashboard provides a rich set of APIs that can be consumed by frontend applications to build interactive visualizations:

- REST endpoints for retrieving cost data
- WebSocket connections for real-time updates
- Exportable data in multiple formats (JSON, CSV, Excel)
- Pre-built visualization components

## Security and Access Control

The dashboard implements several security features:

- Role-based access control for different dashboard views
- Encrypted storage of sensitive cost data
- Audit logging of all budget modifications
- Configurable data retention policies

## Future Enhancements

1. **Enhanced Anomaly Detection**: Machine learning-based cost anomaly detection
2. **Predictive Analytics**: Advanced forecasting based on historical patterns
3. **Auto-optimization**: Automatic adjustment of optimization settings based on budget constraints
4. **Multi-account Management**: Support for managing costs across multiple API provider accounts
5. **Integration with FinOps Tools**: Connection to enterprise financial operations systems

## Conclusion

The Cost Monitoring Dashboard provides comprehensive visibility into API costs and optimization effectiveness. By centralizing cost monitoring and reporting, it enables organizations to make data-driven decisions about their AI usage and ensure optimal resource allocation while preventing budget overruns.
