[CONTEXT: SIMULATION]

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: March 25, 2025  
**Module Reference**: Extends Modules 0-3

## Overview

The Thought Progression Framework defines a structured approach to problem-solving within the WiltonOS system. It outlines three sequential phases that guide the transition from exploratory thinking to concrete action: Tree of Thought (ToT), Chain of Thought (CoT), and Chain of Action (CoA). This framework ensures consistent, traceable problem-solving across system components while preventing context loss during complex processes.

## Framework Components

### Tree of Thought (ToT)

**Definition**: Initial exploration of multiple possibilities, hypotheses, or problem-solving paths before narrowing down to a specific approach.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Divergent thinking pattern
- Broad exploration of the solution space
- Parallel evaluation of multiple options
- Focus on possibility generation over evaluation
- "What could we do?" mindset

**Implementation Patterns**:
- Explicit branching structure with multiple pathways
- Comparative analysis of different approaches
- Pros/cons evaluation for each branch
- Confidence scoring for different hypotheses
- Consideration of edge cases and alternatives

**Example Implementation**:
```typescript
interface ThoughtBranch {
  id: string;
  hypothesis: string;
  reasoning: string;
  confidenceScore: number; // 0-100
  pros: string[];
  cons: string[];
  subBranches?: ThoughtBranch[];
}

function generateTreeOfThought(problem: string): ThoughtBranch[] {
  // Generate multiple hypotheses as branches
  const branches: ThoughtBranch[] = [
    {
      id: 'branch-1',
      hypothesis: 'The system error is caused by insufficient memory allocation',
      reasoning: 'Log files show memory usage spikes before failure',
      confidenceScore: 70,
      pros: ['Explains timing pattern', 'Consistent with error logs'],
      cons: ['Doesn\'t explain why it only happens in production']
    },
    {
      id: 'branch-2',
      hypothesis: 'Database connection pooling is exhausted',
      reasoning: 'Error coincides with peak user activity',
      confidenceScore: 85,
      pros: ['Explains environment difference', 'Consistent with timing'],
      cons: ['No explicit connection errors in logs']
    },
    {
      id: 'branch-3',
      hypothesis: 'Race condition in concurrent request handling',
      reasoning: 'Errors appear random but correlate with load',
      confidenceScore: 60,
      pros: ['Would explain inconsistent reproduction'],
      cons: ['Hard to verify without instrumentation']
    }
  ];
  
  return branches;
}
```

### Chain of Thought (CoT)

**Definition**: Linear sequence of reasoning steps that refines the initial hypotheses into a coherent plan or understanding.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Sequential, logical progression
- Narrowing from multiple options to a single path
- Step-by-step explicit reasoning
- Focus on logical validation
- "How should we think about this?" mindset

**Implementation Patterns**:
- Explicit enumeration of reasoning steps
- Clear transitions between steps
- Evidence-based refinement
- Logical connectors between ideas
- Gradual precision increase

**Example Implementation**:
```typescript
interface ReasoningStep {
  id: string;
  content: string;
  evidence?: string;
  conclusion?: string;
}

function generateChainOfThought(selectedBranch: ThoughtBranch): ReasoningStep[] {
  // Generate sequential reasoning steps
  const reasoningChain: ReasoningStep[] = [
    {
      id: 'step-1',
      content: 'First, we need to verify if database connection pooling is actually being exhausted',
      evidence: 'Our hypothesis is that connection pooling is the issue with 85% confidence'
    },
    {
      id: 'step-2',
      content: 'We should check the connection pool metrics during peak load',
      evidence: 'This will confirm if we're hitting the configured maximum'
    },
    {
      id: 'step-3',
      content: 'If connection pool is maxed out, we need to determine if increasing the pool size is appropriate',
      evidence: 'Need to balance resource usage against performance needs'
    },
    {
      id: 'step-4',
      content: 'We should also verify if connections are being properly released after use',
      evidence: 'Connection leaks could cause pool exhaustion even with proper sizing'
    },
    {
      id: 'step-5',
      content: 'Based on the evidence, we should both check for leaks and increase the pool size temporarily',
      conclusion: 'This two-pronged approach addresses both potential root causes'
    }
  ];
  
  return reasoningChain;
}
```

### Chain of Action (CoA)

**Definition**: Execution of the reasoned plan through concrete, implementable steps with verifiable outcomes.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Concrete, executable actions
- Implementation-focused
- Measurable outcomes and checkpoints
- Focus on practical application
- "What should we do right now?" mindset

**Implementation Patterns**:
- Explicit, unambiguous instructions
- Success criteria for each action
- Resource requirements and constraints
- Sequence dependencies and parallel opportunities
- Validation steps after each action

**Example Implementation**:
```typescript
interface ActionStep {
  id: string;
  action: string;
  expectedOutcome: string;
  validationMethod: string;
  fallbackAction?: string;
  resources?: string[];
  dependencies?: string[]; // IDs of prerequisite steps
}

function generateChainOfAction(reasoningChain: ReasoningStep[]): ActionStep[] {
  // Generate concrete action steps
  const actionChain: ActionStep[] = [
    {
      id: 'action-1',
      action: 'Add database connection pool metrics logging to production environment',
      expectedOutcome: 'Visibility into current connection pool usage patterns',
      validationMethod: 'Confirm metrics appear in monitoring dashboard',
      resources: ['DevOps access', 'Logging configuration change']
    },
    {
      id: 'action-2',
      action: 'Increase connection pool maximum size from 100 to 150',
      expectedOutcome: 'Temporary mitigation of potential pool exhaustion',
      validationMethod: 'Confirm change deployed and verify new limit in config',
      dependencies: ['action-1'],
      resources: ['Database configuration access', 'Change approval']
    },
    {
      id: 'action-3',
      action: 'Add connection leak detection by adding connection creation/close logging',
      expectedOutcome: 'Identification of any connection leaks in application code',
      validationMethod: 'Review logs for unbalanced open/close operations',
      resources: ['Developer access', 'Code modification']
    },
    {
      id: 'action-4',
      action: 'Monitor error rates for 24 hours after changes',
      expectedOutcome: 'Verification that problem is resolved',
      validationMethod: 'Compare error rates before and after changes',
      dependencies: ['action-2', 'action-3'],
      fallbackAction: 'Revert changes if error rate doesn\'t improve'
    }
  ];
  
  return actionChain;
}
```

## Progression Transitions

The framework defines important transition points between phases:

### ToT → CoT Transition

**Trigger Conditions**:
- Sufficient exploration of the solution space
- Identification of a high-confidence hypothesis
- Clear ranking criteria for evaluating branches
- Diminishing returns from additional exploration

**Transition Process**:
1. Evaluate all branches against predefined criteria
2. Select the most promising branch(es)
3. Consolidate insights from exploration
4. Formulate initial reasoning structure

**Example Transition**:
```typescript
function transitionToCoT(branches: ThoughtBranch[]): ThoughtBranch {
  // Sort branches by confidence score
  const sortedBranches = [...branches].sort((a, b) => b.confidenceScore - a.confidenceScore);
  
  // Select highest confidence branch
  const selectedBranch = sortedBranches[0];
  
  // Log the transition decision
  console.log(`Transitioning from ToT to CoT with branch: ${selectedBranch.hypothesis} (confidence: ${selectedBranch.confidenceScore}%)`);
  
  return selectedBranch;
}
```

### CoT → CoA Transition

**Trigger Conditions**:
- Complete logical validation of approach
- Clear implementable conclusion from reasoning
- Sufficient detail to guide concrete actions
- Stakeholder agreement (if applicable)

**Transition Process**:
1. Extract actionable insights from reasoning chain
2. Map each conclusion to specific actions
3. Sequence actions based on dependencies
4. Define success criteria and validation methods

**Example Transition**:
```typescript
function transitionToCoA(reasoningChain: ReasoningStep[]): void {
  // Extract final conclusion
  const finalStep = reasoningChain[reasoningChain.length - 1];
  
  // Verify we have a conclusion
  if (!finalStep.conclusion) {
    throw new Error('Cannot transition to CoA: Reasoning chain lacks conclusion');
  }
  
  // Log the transition decision
  console.log(`Transitioning from CoT to CoA with conclusion: ${finalStep.conclusion}`);
}
```

## Framework Benefits

The ToT → CoT → CoA framework provides several key benefits:

1. **Traceability**: Each action can be traced back to its originating thought process
2. **Balanced Thinking**: Ensures both creative exploration and practical implementation
3. **Transparent Reasoning**: Makes problem-solving steps explicit and reviewable
4. **Error Reduction**: Structured approach catches logical flaws before implementation
5. **Knowledge Transfer**: Facilitates sharing of complete solution rationales

## Integration with Agent System

Different agents in the WiltonOS system have specialized roles within the Thought Progression Framework:

- **Nova (🌌)** excels at ToT, generating diverse hypotheses and creative branches
- **Gemini (♊)** specializes in CoT, developing coherent reasoning chains
