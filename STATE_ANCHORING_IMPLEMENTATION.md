# State Anchoring Implementation

## Overview

The State Anchoring system provides a mechanism for creating persistent snapshots of the Meta-Routing Awareness Protocol (MRAP) state at specific points in time. These anchors can be used to restore the system to a previously captured state, providing stability and facilitating recovery from unwanted changes or system drift.

## Key Components

### 1. Persistence Layer

The persistence layer (`server/services/persistence-layer.js`) implements the core functionality for state anchoring:

- `storeStateAnchor(sessionId, state)`: Creates and stores a new state anchor with a unique identifier
- `getStateAnchor(sessionId, anchorId)`: Retrieves a specific anchor by its ID
- `getStateAnchors(sessionId)`: Lists all anchors available for a session
- `restoreFromAnchor(sessionId, anchorId)`: Restores a system state from a previously created anchor

The persistence layer stores anchors in the file system at `data/persistent-context/anchors/<sessionId>/` as JSON files.

### 2. Meta-Routing API

The Meta-Routing API (`server/routes/meta-routing-api.js`) exposes REST endpoints for working with state anchors:

- `POST /api/meta-routing/anchor-state`: Creates a new state anchor
- `POST /api/meta-routing/restore-state`: Restores system state from an anchor

### 3. Brazilian Wave Integration

The state anchoring system integrates with the Brazilian Wave Protocol, which provides controlled chaos for evolving and restoring system states. This ensures that state transitions are smooth and maintain the 0.7500/0.2494 coherence-exploration ratio.

## State Anchor Structure

A state anchor is a JSON object containing:

```json
{
  "anchorId": "anchor-{timestamp}",
  "name": "User-friendly anchor name",
  "description": "Description of the anchor purpose",
  "timestamp": "ISO date string",
  "sessionId": "Session identifier",
  "coherenceIndex": 0.75,
  "goldenRatioDetected": true,
  "systemState": {
    "quantumPulse": 0.618,
    "fractalSymmetry": 0.382,
    "tBranchRecursion": 1.618,
    "ouroborosEvolution": 0.236
  },
  "metadata": {
    "coherenceAttractor": 0.7500,
    "explorationAttractor": 0.2494
  }
}
```

## Implementation Details

The system creates a unique timestamp-based anchor ID for each anchor point, ensuring that anchors can be created in rapid succession without collisions. The anchors are organized by session ID in the filesystem, allowing multiple independent sessions to maintain their own anchor points.

When restoring from an anchor, the system:

1. Retrieves the stored anchor state
2. Applies a controlled amount of Brazilian Wave chaos (0.3 strength by default)
3. Evolves the system state towards the target anchor state
4. Returns the before and after coherence indices for verification

## Usage Examples

### Creating an Anchor

```javascript
// Store current system state as an anchor
const result = await persistentContextService.storeStateAnchor(sessionId, {
  name: "Pre-optimization state",
  description: "System state before applying optimizations",
  /* Additional state data */
});

// Result contains the new anchorId and timestamp
console.log(`Anchor created with ID: ${result.anchorId}`);
```

### Restoring from an Anchor

```javascript
// Restore system from a previously created anchor
const result = await persistentContextService.restoreFromAnchor(sessionId, anchorId);

if (result.success) {
  console.log(`Successfully restored from anchor: ${result.state.name}`);
} else {
  console.error(`Failed to restore: ${result.error}`);
}
```

## Coherence Maintenance

The state anchoring system is designed to maintain the system's coherence throughout the anchor and restore process. This ensures that the 3:1 â†” 1:3 coherence-exploration ratio (0.7500/0.2494) is preserved, which is a fundamental aspect of the Quantum Coherence Threshold Formula (QCTF).

By integrating with the Brazilian Wave Protocol for controlled state evolution, the system prevents jarring state changes that could disrupt the delicate balance of the Meta-Routing Awareness Protocol.
