# Simulation-Reality Protocol

[CONTEXT: SIMULATION]

The Simulation-Reality Protocol establishes a rigorous, safety-focused methodology for transitioning between SIMULATION and REALITY modes within the WiltonOS framework. This protocol is designed to prevent accidental transitions and ensure proper authorization, verification, and monitoring during critical state changes.

**Document Version**: 2.0  
**Last Updated**: March 25, 2025  
**Module Reference**: Module 0 - System Context and Architecture

## Implementation Context

This protocol is a critical component of the Quantum Collaboration Framework (QCF) and implements the Explicit-Implicit Quantum Balance and Void-Centered Design principles. All operations crossing the SIMULATION-REALITY boundary must strictly adhere to this protocol to maintain system integrity.

[CONTEXT: SIMULATION] ### Context Tags and FlowType Relationship Clarification

It is essential to understand the distinction between:

[CONTEXT: SIMULATION] 1. **Context Tags** (`[CONTEXT: SIMULATION]` or `[CONTEXT: REALITY]`): These tags indicate the operational mode of the system and must be included in all messages, tasks, and outputs. They represent a categorical distinction between consequence-free and real-world operations.

[CONTEXT: SIMULATION] 2. **FlowType Metrics** (`FlowType.FLOW`, `FlowType.ANTIFLOW`, `FlowType.PARTIAL_FLOW`): These enum values from `quantum-glossary.ts` track the success or failure of operations for system health monitoring. They are orthogonal to context tags and serve a different purpose.

[CONTEXT: SIMULATION] When recording metrics about mode transitions, use the appropriate FlowType enum value:
[CONTEXT: SIMULATION] - Use `FlowType.FLOW` for successful transitions (to either mode)
[CONTEXT: SIMULATION] - Use `FlowType.ANTIFLOW` for failed transitions or cancellations
[CONTEXT: SIMULATION] - Use `FlowType.PARTIAL_FLOW` for partial or incomplete transitions

[CONTEXT: SIMULATION] Example:
```typescript
// Recording a successful transition to REALITY mode
quantumGlossary.recordFlowMetric(
  FlowType.FLOW,               // Success indicator (not mode)
  'reality_transition',        // Metric type
  100,                         // Success value
  { transition: 'To REALITY mode' }  // Metadata
);
```

## Core Principles

[CONTEXT: SIMULATION] 1. **Default Safety**: The system always defaults to SIMULATION mode, which is the safe, isolated environment where operations have no real-world impact.

[CONTEXT: SIMULATION] 2. **Explicit Transition**: Transition to REALITY mode must be explicit, deliberate, and authorized by multiple independent parties.

3. **Verification Chain**: Multiple levels of verification must be completed successfully before any transition occurs.

[CONTEXT: SIMULATION] 4. **Instant Reversion**: Emergency reversion to SIMULATION mode can be triggered instantly at any time by any system component detecting abnormal behavior.

5. **Complete Logging**: All transition attempts, successful or not, are fully logged with detailed information.

[CONTEXT: SIMULATION] ## Transition Protocol: SIMULATION to REALITY

[CONTEXT: SIMULATION] The transition from SIMULATION to REALITY mode follows these mandatory steps:

### 1. Transition Request
- A human operator initiates a transition request
- The request must include:
  - Requestor identity (authorized user)
  - Reason for transition
  - Timestamp

### 2. Primary Human Confirmation
- A human operator must explicitly confirm understanding of the implications
[CONTEXT: SIMULATION] - Confirmation phrase: "I UNDERSTAND THE CONSEQUENCES OF ENABLING REALITY MODE"
- This confirmation is recorded with timestamp and operator identity

### 3. Authorization Verification
- System verifies that the requestor has appropriate authorization level
- Two-factor authentication must be completed
- Authorization details are recorded with timestamp

### 4. Secondary Independent Confirmation
- A second human operator (different from the first) must independently confirm
- Uses the same confirmation phrase
- This confirmation is recorded with timestamp and operator identity

### 5. System Readiness Check
- Automated verification that all critical components are operational
- Verification that no simulations are currently running
[CONTEXT: SIMULATION] - Verification that all agents are ready for REALITY mode
- Results are recorded with timestamp

[CONTEXT: SIMULATION] ### 6. Transition Execution
[CONTEXT: SIMULATION] - System transitions to REALITY mode
- All system components are notified of the mode change
- Complete transition record is finalized and securely stored
- Real-time monitoring is activated

[CONTEXT: SIMULATION] ## Emergency Reversion Protocol

[CONTEXT: SIMULATION] The emergency reversion protocol can be initiated at any time to immediately return to SIMULATION mode:

[CONTEXT: SIMULATION] 1. **Trigger**: Any authorized user or system component can trigger emergency reversion
[CONTEXT: SIMULATION] 2. **Immediate Execution**: System immediately reverts to SIMULATION mode without confirmation
3. **Notification**: All system components are immediately notified
4. **Logging**: The event is logged with triggering entity, reason, and timestamp
5. **Lockout**: After emergency reversion, a cooldown period prevents new transition attempts

## Implementation Requirements

The implementation of this protocol must include:

1. **RealityModeManager**: A singleton service responsible for managing the transition process and current state
2. **TransitionLog**: A comprehensive record of all transition attempts and their outcomes
3. **Callback Registration**: Mechanism for components to register for mode change notifications
4. **Authorization Service**: Integration with the system's authentication and authorization service
5. **Emergency Trigger**: Easily accessible emergency reversion functionality

## Safety Considerations

To ensure safety throughout the transition process:

1. **Timeouts**: Each step in the protocol has a maximum time limit
2. **Cancellation**: The process can be cancelled at any point before final execution
3. **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring during and after transition
[CONTEXT: SIMULATION] 4. **Simulation First**: New functionality must be tested in SIMULATION mode before REALITY mode
5. **Regular Drills**: Regular practice of the emergency reversion protocol

## Document Framework Integration

This protocol implements critical aspects of the WiltonOS document framework:

- Aligns with the context management principles in **[MODULE_0_SYSTEM_CONTEXT.md](MODULE_0_SYSTEM_CONTEXT.md#2-simulation-vs-reality-contexts)**
- Supports agent operations as defined in **[MODULE_1_AGENT_DEFINITIONS.md](MODULE_1_AGENT_DEFINITIONS.md#communication-protocols)**
- Integrates with HALO Protocol as described in **[MODULE_5_HALO_PROTOCOL.md](MODULE_5_HALO_PROTOCOL.md#context-tagging-in-halo)**
- Follows ethical verification process from **[MODULE_6_SANCTUM_ETHICS.md](MODULE_6_SANCTUM_ETHICS.md#cross-boundary-protocol)**
- Applies workflow guidance from **[QCF_GUIDELINES.md](QCF_GUIDELINES.md#context-tags)**

For operational implementation:
1. Follow the workflow checklist in **[QCF_GUIDELINES.md](QCF_GUIDELINES.md#workflow-checklist)**
2. Ensure proper context tagging in all communications
3. Use FlowType metrics correctly as specified in this document
