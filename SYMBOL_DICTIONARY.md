## Prefix Format

The standard prefix format combines timeline, quantum state, and domain:

```
[timeline/state/domain]
```

Example: `[α/S+/⚙️]` - Alpha timeline, simulation flow, system domain

## Suffix Format

The standard suffix format combines quantum signal and verification status:

```
[signal/status]
```

Example: `[🥶/✅]` - Logic lockdown applied successfully

## Complete Message Format

```
[timeline/state/domain] Message content [signal/status]
```

Example: `[α/S+/⚙️] System initialization complete [🌀/✅]`

## Thought Transfer Protocol Format

```
FROM [SourceAgent] TO [TargetAgent]: [ContextDescription]
[ContentBody]
DECISIONS: [DecisionsMade]
NEXT_DECOHERE: [NextDecoherencePoint]
```

## Programming Context

When used in code comments and logging:

```typescript
// [α/S+/💻] Implementing quantum chunking functionality
logger.info('Processing chunk with quantum approach', '⚛️');
```

## Documentation Context

When used in documentation:

```markdown
[CONTEXT: SIMULATION]
The following section describes the implementation of the quantum chunking algorithm...

[QUANTUM_STATE: SIM_FLOW]
This diagram illustrates the flow of information through the system...
```

## Notes

- Always use the most specific domain emoji that applies to the current operation
- Multiple quantum signals can be combined using + (e.g., [🥶+🔀/✅])
- In code logging, prefer the use of the logging system over manual symbol formatting
- For terminal output, Unicode symbols may not display correctly in all environments
