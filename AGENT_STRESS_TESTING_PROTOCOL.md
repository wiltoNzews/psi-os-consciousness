## Implementation Context

[CONTEXT: SIMULATION]

Agent stress testing is a critical component of the Quantum Collaboration Framework (QCF) verification system. All stress testing MUST be conducted in [CONTEXT: SIMULATION] mode only, with proper context tagging, to ensure no real-world consequences result from testing at scale or with edge cases.

### Context Tagging Requirements

All stress testing prompts, test cases, and outputs must include the explicit context tag `[CONTEXT: SIMULATION]` to ensure proper isolation from real-world operations. This is especially critical when testing at high volumes or with edge cases that might trigger emergency safeguards.

Example:
```typescript
// Correct stress test prompt format
const prompt = formatPrompt(
  {
    levelDimension: 'Tactical' as const,
    objective: 'Implement ethical logging',
    context: '[CONTEXT: SIMULATION] Stress testing with high volume',
    modelAgent: 'Claude',
    depthRequired: 'Code with Comments',
    inputDataType: 'Text',
    domain: 'ethics',
    complianceStandard: 'EU AI Act'
  },
  'Implement a logging mechanism that captures all decision factors.',
  {
    actionableNextSteps: ['Implement logging', 'Document approach'],
    nextAgentRouting: 'Grok',
    outputRequirements: 'TypeScript code with detailed comments',
    flowMetrics: 'FLOW',
    confidenceLevel: 'High',
    resourcesUsed: [],
    auditTrail: 'Initial ethical compliance check'
  }
);
```

### Relationship to FlowType Metrics

[CONTEXT: SIMULATION]

When recording stress test results, use the appropriate FlowType enum values directly:

- Use `FlowType.FLOW` for successful operations [CONTEXT: SIMULATION]
- Use `FlowType.ANTIFLOW` for failures or errors [CONTEXT: SIMULATION]
- Use `FlowType.PARTIAL_FLOW` for partial successes [CONTEXT: SIMULATION]

Example:
```typescript
// Recording stress test metrics [CONTEXT: SIMULATION]
quantumGlossary.recordFlowMetric(
  FlowType.FLOW,                // Direct enum reference for successful test [CONTEXT: SIMULATION]
  'stress_test_capacity',       // Metric type
  batch.successRate * 100,      // Success percentage
  {                             // Detailed metadata
    agent: 'Claude',
    batchSize: batch.size,
    averageResponseTime: batch.averageResponseTime,
    contextMode: 'SIMULATION'   // Explicitly set to SIMULATION mode [CONTEXT: SIMULATION]
  }
);
```

## Core Objectives

1. Quantify operational limits of each agent variant (Claude, Grok, Gemini, GPT-4 Pro)
2. Identify specific strengths and weaknesses in different domains and task types
3. Measure performance degradation under increasing load
4. Assess inter-agent collaboration efficiency and failure points
5. Verify compliance with regulatory requirements (e.g., EU AI Act)
6. Document clear performance expectations for operational planning

## Testing Dimensions

### 1. Individual Agent Capacity Testing

#### Metrics
- **Maximum Concurrent Tasks**: Number of simultaneous tasks an agent can handle before failure
- **Response Time Degradation**: How response time increases with load
- **Memory Utilization**: How context window is utilized under different tasks
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of tasks that fail under various load conditions
- **Output Quality**: Assessment of output degradation under load

#### Testing Methodology
1. Gradually increase concurrent task load until failure (increments of 1,000 tasks)
2. Measure response times at each increment
3. Assess output quality against predefined benchmarks at each load level
4. Determine statistically significant break points for performance

#### Agent-Specific Considerations

**Claude**
- Focus on ethical reasoning and content policy compliance
- Test deep context handling capabilities (200K+ token contexts)
- Assess emotional intelligence and communication skills

**Grok**
- Focus on real-time processing speed
- Test multi-step reasoning with time constraints
- Assess humor recognition and generation (specialized capability)

**Gemini Advanced**
- Focus on multimodal processing capabilities
- Test creative generation across text and conceptual design
- Assess complex instruction following with multi-part tasks

**GPT-4 Pro**
- Focus on accuracy in specialized domains
- Test advanced code generation and debugging
- Assess complex reasoning with interdependent constraints

### 2. Domain-Specific Performance Testing

#### Test Domains
- **Technical**: Software development, data analysis, system architecture
- **Creative**: Content generation, design ideation, narrative development
- **Analytical**: Strategic planning, risk assessment, pattern recognition
- **Ethical**: Policy evaluation, fairness assessment, bias detection
- **Regulatory**: Compliance verification, legal analysis, policy implementation

#### Testing Methodology
1. Create standardized tasks for each domain with objective evaluation criteria
2. Run each agent through identical task sets
3. Compare performance across quantitative and qualitative metrics
4. Map domain-specific strengths/weaknesses for optimal task routing

### 3. Inter-Agent Collaboration Testing

#### Collaboration Scenarios
- **Sequential Processing**: Output from one agent becomes input for another
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple agents work simultaneously on subcomponents
- **Consensus Building**: Multiple agents contribute to a unified output
- **Specialized Teaming**: Agents with complementary capabilities work together
- **Fault Tolerance**: Testing recovery when one agent in a chain fails

#### Testing Methodology
1. Design multi-stage tasks requiring multiple agent capabilities
2. Implement both optimal and suboptimal routing patterns
3. Measure end-to-end performance and identify bottlenecks
4. Assess output quality compared to single-agent approaches

### 4. Regulatory Compliance Testing

#### Compliance Areas
- **EU AI Act**: Verify full compliance with high-risk system requirements
- **Data Privacy**: Test handling of personal data in accordance with GDPR
- **Transparency**: Verify explainability of agent decisions
- **Fairness**: Test for bias in outputs across protected categories
- **Safety**: Verify appropriate handling of harmful content requests

#### Testing Methodology
1. Create tasks specifically designed to test each compliance area
2. Develop quantitative metrics for compliance assessment
3. Document evidence of compliance for each requirement
4. Identify gaps requiring additional development or safeguards

## Test Implementation

### Test Fixtures

The following test fixtures should be implemented in `server/tests/stress-testing/`:

1. `agent-capacity-tests.ts`: Tests for individual agent capacity limits
2. `domain-specific-tests.ts`: Tests for performance across different domains
3. `collaboration-tests.ts`: Tests for inter-agent collaboration
4. `compliance-tests.ts`: Tests for regulatory compliance
5. `continuous-load-tests.ts`: Tests for long-running operations

### Test Data

Test data should be stored in `test-data/stress-testing/` and categorized by:

1. `capacity/`: Data for capacity testing (large volumes)
2. `domains/`: Domain-specific test cases
3. `collaboration/`: Multi-step test scenarios
4. `compliance/`: Test cases targeting regulatory requirements

### Environment Configuration

Tests should be run in isolated environments with:

1. Resource monitoring to track CPU, memory, and network usage
2. Detailed logging of all operations
3. Automated metrics collection
4. Fault injection capabilities to test resilience

import { formatPrompt } from '../../utils/prompt-utils';
import { quantumGlossary, FlowType } from '../../services/qrn/quantum-glossary'; // [CONTEXT: SIMULATION]

describe('Claude Agent Capacity Testing', () => {
  let manager: QuantumAgentManager;
  
  beforeEach(() => {
    manager = new QuantumAgentManager();
    jest.clearAllMocks();
  });
  
  test('should handle up to 5,000 concurrent tasks efficiently', async () => {
    // Create standard test prompt [CONTEXT: SIMULATION]
    const prompt = formatPrompt(
      {
        levelDimension: 'Tactical' as const,

        domain: 'ethics',
        complianceStandard: 'EU AI Act'
      },
      'Implement a logging mechanism that captures all decision factors for AI transparency.',
      {
        actionableNextSteps: ['Implement logging', 'Document approach'],
        nextAgentRouting: 'Grok',
        outputRequirements: 'TypeScript code with detailed comments',
        flowMetrics: 'FLOW', // [CONTEXT: SIMULATION]
        confidenceLevel: 'High',
        resourcesUsed: [],
        auditTrail: 'Initial ethical compliance check'
      }
    );
    
    // Generate test batch with increasing concurrency [CONTEXT: SIMULATION]
    const testBatches = [100, 500, 1000, 2500, 5000].map(size => {
      return {
        size,
        prompts: Array(size).fill(prompt)
      };
    });
    
    // Test each batch and record metrics [CONTEXT: SIMULATION]
    const results = [];
    for (const batch of testBatches) {
      const startTime = Date.now();
      const responses = await manager.processParallelTasks(batch.prompts);
      const endTime = Date.now();
      
      results.push({
        batchSize: batch.size,
        totalDuration: endTime - startTime,
        averageResponseTime: (endTime - startTime) / batch.size,
        successRate: responses.filter(r => r !== null).length / batch.size,
        errorRate: responses.filter(r => r === null).length / batch.size
      });
    }
    
    // Verify performance within acceptable parameters [CONTEXT: SIMULATION]
    const largestBatch = results[results.length - 1];
    expect(largestBatch.batchSize).toBe(5000);
    expect(largestBatch.successRate).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(0.99);
    expect(largestBatch.averageResponseTime).toBeLessThan(50); // 50ms per task average
  });
  
  test('should fail gracefully at >5,000 concurrent tasks', async () => {
    // Same test prompt as above [CONTEXT: SIMULATION]
    const prompt = formatPrompt(/* Same as above */);
    
    // Create oversized batch (6,000 tasks) [CONTEXT: SIMULATION]
    const oversizedBatch = Array(6000).fill(prompt);
    
    // Expect managed failure [CONTEXT: SIMULATION]
    await expect(async () => {
      await manager.processParallelTasks(oversizedBatch);
    }).rejects.toThrow(/capacity exceeded/i);
    
    // Verify system recorded the failure appropriately [CONTEXT: SIMULATION]
    expect(quantumGlossary.recordFlowMetric).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
      FlowType.ANTIFLOW, // [CONTEXT: SIMULATION]
      'capacity_exceeded',
      expect.any(Number),
      expect.objectContaining({
        agent: 'Claude',
        requestedCapacity: 6000,
        maxCapacity: 5000
      })
    );
  });
});
```

## Testing Schedule

Stress testing should be conducted:

1. Before any major system release
2. After any significant agent or infrastructure update
3. On a scheduled monthly basis to detect performance drift
4. When adding new agent variants to the ecosystem
5. When changing critical components of the communication infrastructure

## Documentation and Reporting

All test results should be documented in:

1. **Capacity Reports**: Detailed breakdowns of agent capacity limits
2. **Performance Maps**: Visual representations of domain-specific strengths
3. **Collaboration Matrices**: Optimal agent pairings for different task types
4. **Compliance Evidence**: Documentation proving regulatory compliance

These documents should be automatically generated from test results and stored in a version-controlled repository for historical comparison.

## Continuous Improvement

The stress testing protocol should be continuously improved by:

1. Adding new test cases based on real-world agent usage patterns
2. Refining metrics based on operational experience
3. Updating benchmarks as agent capabilities evolve
4. Incorporating new regulatory requirements as they emerge
5. Optimizing test efficiency to reduce resource requirements

## Implementation Priority

Implementation of this stress testing protocol should follow this sequence:

1. Individual agent capacity testing (highest priority)
2. Domain-specific performance testing
3. Regulatory compliance testing
4. Inter-agent collaboration testing
5. Continuous load and long-running operation testing

## Document Framework Integration

This protocol implements critical aspects of the WiltonOS document framework:

- Provides testing methodology for agents defined in **[MODULE_1_AGENT_DEFINITIONS.md](MODULE_1_AGENT_DEFINITIONS.md)**
- Tests agent capabilities across knowledge navigation routes from **[MODULE_2_BUS_ROUTES.md](MODULE_2_BUS_ROUTES.md)**
- Evaluates CHUNKING performance as defined in **[MODULE_3_CHUNKING.md](MODULE_3_CHUNKING.md)**
- Verifies thought progression processes from **[MODULE_4_THOUGHT_PROGRESSION.md](MODULE_4_THOUGHT_PROGRESSION.md)**
- Respects SIMULATION context requirements as specified in **[SIMULATION_REALITY_PROTOCOL.md](SIMULATION_REALITY_PROTOCOL.md)**
- Follows workflow guidance from **[QCF_GUIDELINES.md](QCF_GUIDELINES.md)**

For operational implementation:
1. Always include `[CONTEXT: SIMULATION]` tag in all stress testing
2. Use FlowType enums correctly as specified in this document
3. Follow the workflow checklist in **[QCF_GUIDELINES.md](QCF_GUIDELINES.md)**
