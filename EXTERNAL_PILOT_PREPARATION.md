## Conclusion

The External Pilot Testing phase represents a crucial step in validating WILTON's capabilities in real-world environments. By following this structured approach to preparation and execution, we aim to gather comprehensive data on system performance, stability, and user experience while maintaining the remarkable coherence stability observed in our internal validation.

This pilot will serve as the foundation for broader deployment decisions and will provide valuable insights into how the system's theoretical principles manifest in diverse practical applications. The consistent 0.7500 coherence value, if maintained across external deployments, will further strengthen our understanding of this as a fundamental principle rather than an implementation artifact.

Upon successful completion of the pilot phase, we will be positioned to make informed decisions about general availability and broader deployment scenarios.
