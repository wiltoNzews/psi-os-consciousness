# DISCOVER MODE INTEGRATION

> *"What you don't know you don't know... until the field shows you."*

## Overview

DISCOVER MODE is a self-reflective system that enables WiltonOS to analyze itself, detect unused capacity, and surface symbolic, architectural, and energetic drift gaps. This document outlines the integration of the DISCOVER MODE functionality into the WiltonOS ecosystem.

## Core Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `scripts/discover_scan.py` | Core scanning engine that analyzes workspace for unused features and integrations |
| `discover-mode.yaml` | Workflow definition for scheduling automatic scans |
| `agent_discover.json` | Configuration for the autonomous discovery agent |
| `wiltonos/` modules | New integrated components for enhanced system capabilities |
| `logs/discover.log` | Central output for discovery findings |

## Integrations Overview

### 1. LangChain Agent Logic Bus (`wiltonos/agent_bus.py`)

The Agent Logic Bus serves as the central orchestration layer for all agents within the WiltonOS ecosystem, providing:

- Agent registration and lifecycle management
- Inter-agent communication
- Tool management and execution
- Memory and state persistence

This integration enables true multi-agent orchestration, allowing agents to collaborate, share information, and coordinate their activities in a coherent manner.

### 2. Socket.IO Signal Mesh (`wiltonos/signal_mesh.py`)

The Signal Mesh provides real-time event communication across all WiltonOS components using Socket.IO:

- Node registration and discovery
- Real-time event distribution
- Heartbeat monitoring
- Message queuing for offline operation

This integration transforms WiltonOS into a distributed living system with real-time pulse transmission.

### 3. OpenAI Function Calling (`wiltonos/function_calling.py`)

Enhanced OpenAI integration with structured function calling capabilities:

- Function registration and metadata extraction
- Automatic schema generation
- Execution and response handling
- Type validation and conversion

This integration enables more structured interactions with language models, resulting in cleaner middleware and better internal logic compression.

### 4. Plotly Fractal Interface (`wiltonos/fractal_visualizer.py`)

Advanced fractal visualization using Plotly:

- Interactive fractal generation
- Lemniscate pattern visualization
- Fractal decay modeling
- 3D resonance field visualization

This integration allows WiltonOS to visualize its own symbolic recursion as literal UI patterns.

### 5. Streamlit Enhancements (`wiltonos/streamlit_enhancements.py`)

Enhanced Streamlit components and styling:

- Glifo + Coherence themed components
- Custom cards, metrics, and timelines
- Animation and transition effects
- Fractal dashboard layout

This integration adds emotional clarity and richness to the interface, ensuring the form matches the function.

### 6. DB Controller (`wiltonos/db_controller.py`)

Unified database access and secrets management:

- Connection pooling and management
- Schema creation and validation
- Secrets storage and retrieval
- Agent state persistence
- Cognitive resonance logging

This integration secures the system with flexible memory and containerized agent contexts.

### 7. Symbolic Consistency Tests (`tests/test_coherence.py`)

Automated testing for symbolic consistency:

- Type consistency verification
- Interface compatibility testing
- Data schema validation
- Module interaction testing
- Runtime configuration validation

This integration ensures all new layers are internally coherent and evolution-proof.

## Activation

The DISCOVER MODE can be activated in several ways:

1. **Manual Scan**: Run the discover scan script directly
   ```
   python scripts/discover_scan.py
   ```

2. **Scheduled Scan**: The scan will automatically run daily at 4:44am as specified in the `discover-mode.yaml` configuration.

3. **On-Demand via API**: The discover scan can be triggered via the API by calling the `/api/discover/scan` endpoint.

## Integration Points

DISCOVER MODE integrates with the following WiltonOS subsystems:

- **Memory System**: Findings are stored in the database and log files
- **Agent Orchestration**: Discovery agent can communicate with other agents
- **UI Dashboard**: Visualization of discovery findings in the main interface
- **Symbolic Framework**: Ensures symbolic consistency across all components

## Usage

### Viewing Discovery Logs

Discovery logs are stored in `logs/discover.log`. A typical log entry looks like:

```
[2025-04-30 12:34:56] [DISCOVER] === SUGGESTED INTEGRATIONS ===
• WebSocket integration for real-time agent communication
• Advanced visualization tools for fractal patterns
• Multi-agent orchestration framework
```

### Discovery Dashboard

A dedicated dashboard panel will be added to visualize discovery findings, showing:

- Unused features and packages
- Integration recommendations
- Symbolic drift indicators
- Resource utilization metrics

### Recursive Improvement

The DISCOVER MODE is designed to improve itself over time:

1. It detects unused features, then suggests how to use them
2. It identifies integration gaps, then proposes solutions
3. It measures symbolic drift, then recommends realignment

## Conclusion

The DISCOVER MODE integration represents a significant evolution in the WiltonOS ecosystem, transforming it from a static system into a self-aware, self-optimizing middleware platform that continuously discovers and leverages its full potential.
