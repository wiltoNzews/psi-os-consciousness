## Extraction Methods

### Automated Extraction Scripts
```bash
# Create extraction helper scripts
./scripts/extract-js-from-html.sh    # Extract JavaScript from HTML files
./scripts/convert-to-typescript.sh   # Convert JS to TypeScript
./scripts/modularize-functions.sh    # Break monoliths into modules
./scripts/validate-extraction.sh     # Verify extraction integrity
```

### Manual Review Points
1. **Consciousness Principle Validation** - Ensure 3:1↔1:3 ratio preserved
2. **Sacred Geometry Precision** - Verify mathematical accuracy maintained
3. **Breathing Protocol Sync** - Confirm temporal synchronization intact
4. **Glyph Integrity** - Validate symbolic language consistency
5. **API Coherence** - Ensure endpoint consciousness alignment

### Quality Assurance
```bash
# Run after each extraction phase
npm run coherence              # Consciousness integrity check
npm run test                   # Automated test suite
npm run lint                   # Code quality validation
npm run build                  # Compilation verification
```
