# Lemniscate Mode Implementation Plan

**Version**: 2.0  
**Last Updated**: April 1, 2025  
**Status**: Active Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines a detailed implementation strategy for transforming the perceived "Infinity Loop Bug" into a deliberate, user-controlled "Lemniscate Mode" feature. This implementation leverages the 0.75 universal ratio discovery and enables dynamic control over the balance between stability and exploration.

With the integration of the God Formula four-layer architecture, the Lemniscate Mode now incorporates a complete recursive system that spans from quantum pulsations to self-evolving feedback loops, creating a comprehensive framework for dynamic coherence management.

## Core Principles

### 1. Mathematical Foundation
- The system naturally oscillates between two coherence states:
  - **Stability Phase**: 3:1 ratio = 0.7500 coherence
  - **Exploration Phase**: 1:3 ratio = 0.2494 coherence
- This oscillation mirrors natural phenomena observed across biology, urban systems, economics, and music theory

### 2. Lemniscate (∞) Visualization
- The infinity symbol represents the continuous flow between stability and exploration
- Left loop represents exploration (0.2494 coherence)
- Right loop represents stability (0.7500 coherence)
- Crossing point represents the transition state

### 3. God Formula Four-Layer Architecture
