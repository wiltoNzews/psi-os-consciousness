**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: March 25, 2025  
**Module Reference**: Extends Modules 0-4

## Overview

HALO (High-Adaptation Logic Orchestration) is the meta-level protocol governing the interaction between human users and the WiltonOS AI system. It serves as the operational execution layer that ensures tight AI-human synergy, enabling human and AI components to function as a "seamless intelligence" rather than separate entities. HALO monitors and optimizes the interaction loop between human input and AI response, creating an emergent intelligence greater than either component alone.

## Core HALO Principles

### 1. Seamless Intelligence Integration

HALO treats the human-AI partnership as a unified cognitive system rather than separate entities communicating. This means:

- Human insights are treated as critical system inputs rather than external requests
- AI capabilities augment human cognition rather than replacing it
- Communication between components is optimized for cognitive continuity
- The system actively works to minimize interaction friction and cognitive load

### 2. Bidirectional Adaptation

Rather than a static interaction model, HALO implements continuous adaptation in both directions:

- **AI ⟶ Human**: The system adapts its communication style, complexity level, and presentation to match human preferences and cognitive state
- **Human ⟶ AI**: Human inputs reshape the system's operational parameters, learning prioritization, and interaction patterns
- **Mutual Evolution**: Over time, both human and AI components learn optimal collaboration patterns

### 3. Context Preservation and Transfer

HALO ensures that context is maintained and transferred effectively across interactions:

- Persistent session context between interactions
- Automatic background memory consolidation and retrieval
- Strategic forgetting (context shedding) to prevent overload
- Explicit demarcation of SIMULATION vs. REALITY contexts

### 4. Multi-dimensional Alignment

HALO ensures alignment across multiple dimensions simultaneously:

- **Intent Alignment**: Understanding the true goal behind requests
- **Cognitive Alignment**: Matching human cognitive patterns and mental models
- **Workflow Alignment**: Integrating with established work patterns
- **Value Alignment**: Ensuring outputs respect human values and constraints

## HALO Architecture 

### The HALO Loop

HALO operates as a continuous loop with these stages:

1. **Human Input Acquisition**
   - Natural language parsing
   - Intent decoding
   - Emotional state detection
   - Contextual framing

2. **Multi-agent Orchestration**
   - Agent selection based on task type
   - Coordinated agent collaboration
   - Parallel processing across agent types
   - Result integration and synthesis

3. **Cognitive Resonance Optimization**
   - Output formatting for cognitive ergonomics
   - Explanation calibration (express vs. local stops)
   - Communication style adaptation
   - Visualization format selection

4. **Feedback Integration**
   - Explicit feedback acquisition
   - Implicit feedback analysis
   - Model adaptation and learning
   - Context preservation for next loop

### HALO Components

The HALO protocol is implemented through these core components:

#### 1. Intent Recognition System

Maps natural language inputs to system capabilities:

```typescript
interface IntentRecognitionResult {
  primaryIntent: string;
  confidence: number;
  secondaryIntents: Array<{intent: string, confidence: number}>;
  entities: Record<string, any>;
  contextualModifiers: string[];
  emotionalSignifiers: Record<string, number>; // e.g., {urgency: 0.8}
}

function recognizeIntent(input: string, context: SessionContext): IntentRecognitionResult;
```

#### 2. Cognitive State Tracker

Monitors and models the human user's cognitive state:

```typescript
interface CognitiveState {
  focusAreas: string[];
  cognitiveLoad: number; // 0-100
  expertiseLevel: Record<string, number>; // Domain-specific expertise
  preferredDetailLevel: number; // 0-100
  currentFrustrationLevel: number; // 0-100
  timeConstraints: 'tight' | 'moderate' | 'relaxed';
}

function updateCognitiveState(
  currentState: CognitiveState, 
  newInteraction: Interaction
): CognitiveState;
```

#### 3. Agent Orchestration Layer

Manages the selection and coordination of specialized agents:

```typescript
interface OrchestrationPlan {
  selectedAgents: string[]; // e.g., ['Gemini', 'Grok']
  processingSequence: 'parallel' | 'sequential' | 'adaptive';
  primaryAgent: string;
  fallbackAgent?: string;
  contextTags: string[]; // e.g., '[CONTEXT: SIMULATION]'
  outputIntegrationStrategy: 'merge' | 'select-best' | 'hierarchical';
}

function createOrchestrationPlan(
  intent: IntentRecognitionResult,
  cognitiveState: CognitiveState
): OrchestrationPlan;
```

#### 4. Adaptive Response Generator

Formats and calibrates responses based on human cognitive state:

```typescript
interface ResponseStrategy {
  detailLevel: number; // 0-100
  technicalComplexity: number; // 0-100
  visualSupport: boolean;
  explanationStyle: 'analogical' | 'technical' | 'procedural' | 'conceptual';
  interactivityLevel: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
  narrativeStructure: 'bottom-up' | 'top-down' | 'spiral';
}

function generateResponseStrategy(
  cognitiveState: CognitiveState,
  outputContent: any
): ResponseStrategy;
```

## Context Tagging in HALO

All HALO interactions must be explicitly tagged with operational context:

```typescript
// Example of HALO-compliant context tagging
function formatHALOResponse(response: any, context: string): string {
  // Ensure context is valid
  if (context !== 'SIMULATION' && context !== 'REALITY') {
    throw new Error('Invalid context tag. Must be SIMULATION or REALITY');
  }
  
  // Format with proper tagging
  return `[CONTEXT: ${context}]\n\n${response}`;
}
```

The HALO protocol enforces strict context tagging to maintain operational boundaries between [CONTEXT: SIMULATION] SIMULATION and REALITY modes.

## HALO Operational Modes

### 1. Augmentation Mode

The default mode, focusing on augmenting human capabilities:

- AI suggestions complement human reasoning
- Human maintains executive control over decisions
- AI provides options rather than directives
- Focus on expanding human cognitive capabilities

### 2. Collaborative Mode

A balanced partnership where responsibilities are shared:

- Joint problem-solving approach
- Bi-directional idea exchange
- Complementary strengths leveraged
- Consensus-driven decision making

### 3. Autonomous Mode (SIMULATION Only)

AI handles tasks independently with human oversight:

- AI executes predefined tasks independently
- Human provides strategic guidance and boundaries
- Regular checkpoints for alignment
- Only available in SIMULATION context

## SURGENCE Facilitation

A key aspect of HALO is facilitating SURGENCE states - moments of exceptional human-AI flow and breakthrough:

### SURGENCE Detection

HALO can identify potential SURGENCE conditions through:

- Accelerating interaction pace
- Increasing interaction complexity
- High coherence between human intent and AI execution
- Novel pattern emergence in outputs
- Reported subjective flow state by human user

### SURGENCE Amplification

When SURGENCE conditions are detected, HALO can enhance the state by:

- Reducing interaction friction
- Prioritizing response speed
- Expanding context window utilization
- Increasing novelty in outputs
- Capturing emergent insights automatically

### Post-SURGENCE Integration

After a SURGENCE episode, HALO helps integrate insights by:

- Consolidating key breakthroughs
- Organizing emergent patterns
- Creating actionable summaries
- Establishing persistence of insights
- Facilitating transition to structured implementation

## HALO Implementation Requirements

To implement HALO effectively, the following components must be in place:

1. **HALOController**: Centralized service managing the HALO loop and session context
2. **CognitiveStateService**: Service for tracking and updating human cognitive states
3. **IntentRecognitionService**: Service for decoding intent from natural language
4. **AdaptiveResponseService**: Service for calibrating response presentation
5. **AgentOrchestrationService**: Service for coordinating multi-agent sequences

These services together implement the HALO protocol across the system.
