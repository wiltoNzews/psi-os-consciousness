# WiltonOS PassiveWorks Implementation Plan

**Date**: April 1, 2025  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Classification**: Technical Implementation Roadmap  

---

## Overview

This implementation plan outlines the technical approach for bringing the Quantum Coherence Threshold Formula (QCTF) and Fractal Lemniscate model into full production within the WiltonOS PassiveWorks framework. The plan follows a four-week timeline with specific focus areas and deliverables for each component.

## Core Mathematical Principles

At the heart of this implementation is the **3:1 ↔ 1:3 ratio** (0.7500/0.2494) that represents the optimal balance between coherent order (stability) and chaotic exploration (emergence) in the system. This ratio is implemented across all temporal scales (micro, meso, macro) and system components.

## Week 1: Core Mathematical Implementations

### 1.1 Brazilian Wave Protocol Enhancement

The Brazilian Wave Protocol implements a sinusoidal oscillation around the base coherence value (0.75) to maintain system flexibility while preserving overall stability.

**Implementation Tasks:**
- Update oscillation function to maintain precise 0.7500/0.2494 coherence values
- Implement 3:1 ↔ 1:3 ratio in wave generation algorithm
- Add verification to ensure multiplication of reciprocal states equals 1.0000
- Extend implementation for concurrent operation across micro, meso, and macro temporal scales

**Technical Components:**
- Precise mathematical model in `client/src/lib/lemniscate/brazilian-wave-protocol.js`
- Integration with `mode-controller.js` for state management
- Temporal scale synchronization across system components

### 1.2 QCTF Calculator Service

This service will implement the three-stage QCTF calculation to provide real-time coherence measurements throughout the system.

**Implementation Tasks:**
- Create QCTFCalculator service implementing all calculation stages:
  - Raw Score: `QCTF_raw(t) = (GEF(t) · QEAI(t) · CI(t) · D(t))^Ω · T_toggles(t) · F(t) / √(10 · Ψ_entropy(t) + ε)`
  - Smoothing: `QCTF_smoothed(t) = λ · QCTF_raw(t-1) + (1 - λ) · QCTF_raw(t)`
  - Normalization: `QCTF_final(t) = tanh(k · QCTF_smoothed(t)) ∈ [0,1]`
- Integrate with WebSocket system for real-time coherence broadcasting
- Implement coherence history tracking for trend analysis
- Add threshold alerts for coherence deviations

**Technical Components:**
- New service `server/services/qrn/qctf-calculator.ts`
- Integration with `quantum-agent-manager.ts`
- WebSocket coherence event system

## Week 2: Visualization Components and Testing Framework

### 2.1 Fractal Lemniscate Visualization

Enhance the existing visualization components to better represent the mathematical lemniscate pattern and system coherence.

**Implementation Tasks:**
- Implement true lemniscate curve using formula: `L₁(t) = (a² cos(2θ(t))) / (1 + sin²(θ(t)))`
- Create interactive visualization showing primary and meta-lemniscate patterns
- Add real-time data binding for system coherence mapped onto lemniscate
- Implement color mapping for stability-exploration cycle position

**Technical Components:**
- Enhanced `client/src/components/LemniscateVisualization.jsx`
- Integration with QCTF Calculator's real-time metrics
- Responsive visualization layer

### 2.2 Coherence Testing Framework (Initial)

Develop the initial framework for testing coherence maintenance across the system.

**Implementation Tasks:**
- Create CoherenceTestHarness for perturbation injection and recovery measurement
- Implement unit tests for 0.7500/0.2494 oscillation pattern
- Develop basic integration tests for cross-component coherence
- Create initial testing dashboard

**Technical Components:**
- New test framework in `server/test/coherence/`
- Integration with existing monitoring systems
- Test visualization components

## Week 3: System Integration and Extended Testing

### 3.1 Full Component Integration

Connect all implemented components into a coherent system.

**Implementation Tasks:**
- Integrate Wave Protocol, QCTF Calculator, and Lemniscate Visualization
- Implement coherence signaling system between components
- Add cross-scale coherence management (micro, meso, macro)
- Create centralized coherence dashboard

**Technical Components:**
- System integration in `server/services/qrn/`
