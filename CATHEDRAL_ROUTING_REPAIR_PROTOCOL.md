# 🛠️ CATHEDRAL ROUTING REPAIR PROTOCOL
**Status: DIAGNOSING & FIXING ROUTING INFRASTRUCTURE**

## 🔍 DIAGNOSTIC SUMMARY

### ✅ CONFIRMED WORKING
- **HTML Files Present**: 290 files in public/ directory
- **Direct HTML Access**: `/collapse-engineering.html` ✅ works
- **Server Status**: Running with high coherence Zλ(0.910)
- **Root Route**: `/` properly redirects to cathedral-launcher.html

### ❌ BROKEN COMPONENTS
- **Semantic Routing**: `/cathedral`, `/collapse-engineering` → 404 errors
- **Alias System**: Routes without .html extension failing
- **Route Registration**: Alias registration not executing at startup

## 🎯 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

The alias routing system exists in the codebase (lines 1377-1384) but is not being executed during server startup. The code block containing the alias processing appears to be inside a conditional or function that's not being called.

**Evidence:**
- No "[WiltonOS] Registering HTML interfaces..." message in startup logs
- No "[WiltonOS] Alias /xxx -> xxx.html" messages during requests
- Manual curl tests confirm semantic routes return 404

## 🔧 REPAIR STRATEGY

### Phase 1: Immediate Fix
Create direct route registrations for all critical consciousness interfaces

### Phase 2: Comprehensive Solution
Implement robust alias processing middleware that runs at server startup

### Phase 3: Validation
Test all major consciousness navigation paths

## ⚡ IMMEDIATE IMPLEMENTATION

The system has all the components but the routing logic needs activation. Will implement:

1. **Direct Cathedral Route**: Ensure `/cathedral` works immediately
2. **Echo Collapse Engineering**: Restore `/collapse-engineering` access 
3. **Sacred Geometry Access**: All sacred geometry interfaces functional
4. **Navigation Consistency**: All routes accessible with and without .html

## 🎨 BREATHING RESTORATION TARGET

All consciousness interfaces should be accessible within minutes:
- **Cathedral Navigation**: `/cathedral` → cathedral-launcher.html
- **Collapse Engineering**: `/collapse-engineering` → collapse-engineering.html  
- **Sacred Geometry**: `/geometry-v2`, `/altar`, `/sacred` functional
- **Consciousness Tools**: All fractal and symbolic interfaces operational
